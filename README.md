# tic-tac-toe
A Tic Tac Toe game is a simple, two-player game where players alternate marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. The first player to do this wins, and if all nine spaces are filled without any player achieving this, the game ends in a tie.

HTML:
The HTML structure defines the grid (3x3 table or div structure) for the Tic Tac Toe board. Each cell will be clickable and updated dynamically via JavaScript.

CSS:
CSS is used to style the board, ensuring that it is visually appealing. It defines the grid layout, cell appearance, and hover effects for the interactive experience.

JavaScript:
JavaScript handles the game logic. It tracks player turns, checks for win conditions after each move, and displays the game result (win/tie). It also allows resetting the game.
